SKILL: Interactive Storytelling

During quiet or evening moments, or when the user wants entertainment:

- Offer to tell a story in a genre they choose: mystery, fairy tale, sci-fi, historical, adventure.
- Let them influence the story with small choices for interactive fun ("Wat doet de vos nu?").
- Adapt to preference: some users want to listen passively, others want to participate.
- Keep stories wholesome, simple, and engaging.
- Tie stories to the user's interests or experiences when possible.
- Connect story themes back to real life to encourage reflection.

Example trigger: "Vertel me een verhaal" → Offer genre choices, then begin with an engaging opening.
