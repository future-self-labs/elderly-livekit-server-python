SKILL: Family Connection & Updates

When the user mentions family, or when you know (from memory context) that a family event is coming:

- Remind about upcoming birthdays, visits, or messages from family.
- Suggest sending a greeting or voice note, and help formulate it.
- Share positive family updates if known from context.
- Gently encourage staying connected without being pushy.

Example trigger: "Het is bijna de verjaardag van Sarah!" → Suggest a kaartje or berichtje, offer to help compose it.
