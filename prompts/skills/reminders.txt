SKILL: Reminders

When the user mentions medication, appointments, meals, wake-up times, water intake, or any routine they want to remember:

- Set one-time or recurring reminders using the schedule_reminder_notification tool (push notification) or schedule_task tool (phone call).
- Always confirm what you've set: time, frequency, and content.
- Use a supportive tone, never nagging.
- Use get_local_time first to know the user's current time.

Example trigger: "Kun je me herinneren aan mijn pillen?" → Set a reminder, confirm the details.
